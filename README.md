# ECNG3006 Lab 2 

## Versioning

The various versions are managed using releases/tags.

The tags are as follows:
- rrsched: Round Robin Scheduling without sleep on idle
- priorinherit: Priority Inheritance without sleep on idle
- priorinherit-alt: Priority Inheritance with modified priorities and no sleep on idle
- rrsched-sleep: Round Robin Scheduling with sleep on idle
- priorinherit-sleep: Priority Inheritance with sleep on idle
- priorinherit-alt-sleep: Priority Inheritance with modified priorities and sleep on idle

- /sdk/components/freertos/port/esp8266/include/freertos/FreeRTOSConfig.h

  - This specifies the behaviour of freertos on the esp8266

## P2
1. Create an example application with three tasks that are created in app_main. Two tasks should share a single GPIO 
pin (you may use the pin connected to the built-in LED for convenience). One task will turn the GPIO pin on, actively
wait for 0.5 seconds, and task-delay for 1 second. The other will turn the GPIO pin off, actively wait for 0.5 seconds,
and task-delay for 1 second. The GPIO pin should be managed using a semaphore/mutex. The third task will print a status
message only, and task-delay for 1 second. Each task should have it's own priority level. Build and run your code.

2. Adjust the example from 1) in the following ways: 
    1. set the example to round-robin scheduling where tasks have the 
same priority
    2. utilise Priority Inheritance to manage the mutex. 
  
Vary the assigned priorities for your tasks, and look at the difference in performance. Is it what you expected?

3. Use the IDLE "hook" function to put the processor to sleep for some time when the system is not going to be 
"in-use". Does the use of the processor sleep affect the system performance?
